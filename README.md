# cipher-challange

Hello to anyone who randomly stumbles across this. This is a repository containing all of the code me and my team Ovo Et Amicis used during the 2025-26 National Cipher Challange hosted by the University of Southampton. It also contains one of my school projects that I thought were similar and amalgamated most of the projects in here so if someone wanted a "neater" version they could look to that.

We are a team of 16 year olds who were only taught vb.net, hence why this repository is in an unused and slightly useless language. However it does thankfully compile the code so you can find the .exe files by going into a program folder > bin > Debug and the .exe should be there. It may be called something random like ConsoleAppX but it still runs the code.

Apologies for the lack of UI. I may add some in the future but these were meant to be very utilitarian, straight to the point and as quick and easy to knock up as possible. No thought of optimisation or clean code would have been used and there are magic numbers being thrown around everywhere. It made sense to us and we knew how it worked and thats all we really cared about. Apologies for the slight horrors you may see

I do want to credit my good friend Stef. He wrote and looked over most of the code along with me and so I owe a big part of this repository to him

Thanks for checking the repository out. If on the offchance you did have any burning questions I think its an issue you open. This is my first public repository so im just getting started with the inner workings. Hope this helps someone however many years in the future
